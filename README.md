## Planning and Development Process:
I begain my plan with designing the layouts in figma to see what the app look like. After that, I searched for API that I can use it in my app but, Icouldn't know how to deal with it. So, I create my own Api in MockAPI. Then, I design the layouts in xml files, Last thing, I started my codes.
### Problems-solving strategy:
If have some obstacles at a certain point I serach about that point. if I do not find it, asked classmates or instructional team.
